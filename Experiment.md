# HE stain

## Definition
### Name
Hematoxylin and eosin stain (or haematoxylin and eosin stain or hematoxylin-eosin stain) is often abbreviated as H&E stain or HE stain.
### Application
It is one of the principal tissue stains used in histology.

## Purpose
1. Differentiate between the nuclear and cytoplasmic parts of a cell  
3. Overall patterns of coloration from the stain show the general layout and distribution of cells 
4. Provide a general overview of a tissue sample's structure
5. Biopsy of a suspected cancer

## Step
1. Hematoxylin stains **cell nuclei a purplish blue**
2. Eosin stains the **extracellular matrix and cytoplasm pink**, with other structures taking on different shades, hues, and combinations of these colors
