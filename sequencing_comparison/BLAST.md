# BLAST

## What is BLAST used for?
The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences.

## Data types: 
1. nucleotide 
2. Protein sequences 

## How it works?
The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches.

## Model

# Algorithm for alignment
## Global alignment
Comparing two all sequences
It can be used for examing similarity between new sequencing and old sequencing.
### Example
Needleman-Wunsch
